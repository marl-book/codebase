# Getting Started

## Installation

We *strongly* suggest you use a virtual environment for the instructions below. A good starting point is [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Then, clone and install the repository using: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/semitable/fast-marl.git
cd fast-marl
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Running an algorithm
This project uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) to structure its configuration. Algorithm implementations can be found under `fastmarl/`. The respective configs are found in `fastmarl/configs/algorithms/`.

You would first need an environment that is registered in OpenAI's Gym. This repository uses the Gym API (with the only difference being that the rewards are a tuple - one for each agent). 

A good starting point would be [Level-based Foraging](https://github.com/semitable/lb-foraging) and [RWARE](https://github.com/semitable/robotic-warehouse). You can install both using:
```sh
pip install -U lbforaging rware
```

Then, running an algorithm (e.g. A2C) looks like:

```sh
cd fastmarl
python run.py +algorithm=ac env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-2p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25
```

Similarly, running DQN can be done using:
```sh
python run.py +algorithm=dqn env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-2p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25
```

Overriding hyperparameters is easy and can be done in the command line. An example of overriding the `batch_size` in DQN:
```sh
python run.py +algorithm=dqn env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-2p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25 algorithm.batch_size=256
```

Find other hyperparameters in the files under `fastmarl/configs/algorithm`.

### (Optional) Use Hydra's tab completion
Hydra also supports tab completion for filling in the hyperparameters. Install it using or see [here](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/basic/running_your_app/tab_completion) for other shells (`zsh` or `fish`).
```sh
eval "$(python run.py -sc install=bash)"
```
## Running a hyperparameter search

Can be easily done using [Hydra's multirun](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/basic/running_your_app/multi-run) option. An example of sweeping over batch sizes is:

```sh
python run.py -m +algorithm=dqn env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-2p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25 algorithm.batch_size=64,128,256
```

### An advanced hyperparameter search using `search.py`
*This section might get deprecated in the future if Hydra implements this feature.*

We include a script named `search.py` which reads a search configuration file (e.g. the included `configs/sweeps/dqn.lbf.yaml`) and runs a hyperparameter search in one or more tasks. The script can be run using
```sh
python search.py run --config configs/sweeps/dqn.lbf.yaml --seeds 5 locally
```
In a cluster environment where one run should go to a single process, it can also be called in a batch script like:
```sh
python search.py run --config configs/sweeps/dqn.lbf.yaml --seeds 5 single $TASK_ID
```
Where `$TASK_ID` is an index for the experiment (i.e. 1...#number of experiments).

## Logging
We implement two loggers: FileSystem Logger and WandB Logger.

### File System Logger
The default logger is the FileSystemLogger which saves experiment results in a `results.csv` file. You can find that file, the configuration that has been used & more under `outputs/{env_name}/{alg_name}/{random_hash}` or `multirun/{date}/{time}/{experiment_id}` for multiruns.
### WandB Logger
By appending `+logger=wandb` in the command line you can get support for WandB. Do not forget to `wandb login` first.

Example:

```sh
python run.py +algorithm=dqn env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-2p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25 logger=wandb
```
You can override the project name using:

```sh
python run.py +algorithm=dqn env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-2p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25 logger=wandb logger.project_name="my-project-name"
```

# Implementing your own algorithm/ideas

The fastest way would be to create a new folder starting from the algorithm of your choice e.g.
```sh
cp -R ac ac_new_idea
```
and create a new configuration file:
```sh
cp configs/algorithm/ac.yaml configs/algorithm/ac_new_idea.yaml
```

with the editor of your choice, open `ac_new_idea.yaml` and change
```yaml
...
algorithm:
  _target_: ac.train.main
  name: "ac"
  model:
    _target_: ac.model.Policy
...
```
to 
```yaml
...
algorithm:
  _target_: ac_new_idea.train.main
  name: "ac_new_idea"
  model:
    _target_: ac_new_idea.model.Policy
...
```
Make any changes you want to the files under `ac_new_idea/` and run it using:

```sh
python run.py +algorithm=ac_new_idea env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-2p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25
```
You can now add new hyperparameters, change the training procedure, or anything else you want and keep the old implementations for easy comparison. We hope that the way we have implemented these algorithms makes it easy to change any part of the algorithm without the hustle of reading through large code-bases and huge unnecessary layers of abstraction. RL research benefits from iterating over ideas quickly to see how they perform!

# Interpreting your results

We have multiple tools to analyze the outputs of FileSystemLogger (for WandBLogger, just login to their webpage).
First, export the data of multiple runs using:
```sh
python utils/postprocessing/export_multirun.py --folder folder/containing/results --export-file myfile.hd5
```

The file will contain two pandas DataFrames: `df` which contains all `mean_episode_returns` (by default summed across all agents), and `config` which contains information about the tested hyperparameters.  
You can load both through Python using:
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_hdf(exported_file, "df")
configs = pd.read_hdf(exported_file, "configs")
```
The imported DataFrames look like the ones below. `df` has a multi-index column indexing the environment name, the algorithm name, a hash unique to the parameter search, and a seed. `configs` maps the hash to the full configuration of the run.

```ipython

...

```

You can easily find the best hyperparameter configuration per environment/algorithm using: 
```sh
python utils/postprocessing/find_best_hyperparams.py  --exported-file myfile.hd5
```

You can plot the best runs (average/std across seeds) using:
```sh
python utils/postprocessing/plot_best_runs.py --exported-file lbf.dqn.hd5
```

Finally you can use [HiPlot](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hiplot) to interactively visualize the performance of various hyperparameter configurations using:
```sh 
pip install -U hiplot
hiplot fastmarl.utils.postprocessing.hiplot_fetcher.experiment_fetcher
```
You will have to enter `exp://myfile.hd5/env_name/alg_name` in the browser's textbox.

## Parameter Sharing

Parameter sharing across agents is optional and being done behind the scenes in the torch model.
There are three types of parameter sharing:
- No Parameter Sharing (default)
- Full Parameter Sharing
- Selective Parameter Sharing ([Christianos et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07475.pdf))

In DQN you can enable either of these using:
```sh
python run.py +algorithm=dqn env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-4p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25 algorithm.model.critic.parameter_sharing=False
python run.py +algorithm=dqn env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-4p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25 algorithm.model.critic.parameter_sharing=True
python run.py +algorithm=dqn env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-4p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25 algorithm.model.critic.parameter_sharing=[0,0,1,1]
```
for each of the methods respectively. For Selective Parameter Sharing, you need to supply a list of indices pointing to the network that is going to be used for each agent. Example: `[0,0,1,1]` as above makes the agents `0` and `1` share network `0` and agents `2` and `3` share the network `1`. Similarly `[0,1,1,1]` would make the first agent not share parameters with anyone, and the other three would share parameters.

In Actor-Critic methods you would need to seperately define parameter sharing for the Actor and the Critic. The respective config is `algorithm.model.actor.parameter_sharing=...` and `algorithm.model.critic.parameter_sharing=...`
## Value Decomposition

We have implemented VDN on top of the DQN algorithm. To use you only have to load the respective algorithm config:

```sh
python run.py +algorithm=vdn env.name="lbforaging:Foraging-8x8-4p-3f-v2" env.time_limit=25
```

Note that for this to work we use the `CooperativeReward` wrapper that _sums_ the rewards of all agents before feeding them to the training algorithm. If you have an environment that already has a cooperative reward, you still need it to return a *list of rewards* (e.g. `reward = n_agents * [reward/n_agents]`).
